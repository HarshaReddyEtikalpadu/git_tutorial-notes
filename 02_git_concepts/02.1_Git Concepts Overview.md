# Git Concepts Overview ðŸ“š

This document provides an overview of key Git internals and concepts covered in the `03_git-concepts` folder.

## Working Directory, Staging Area, and Local Repository

- **Working Directory:** Your local files and folders where you edit and code.
- **Staging Area (Index):** The intermediate area where changes are prepared (staged) before committing.
- **Local Repository:** The `.git` folder on your machine that stores committed snapshots and metadata.
- **Remote Repository:** The repo got saved in git hosting platform(Eg: GitHub).

These components work together in Gitâ€™s workflow to efficiently track and manage changes.

## Untracked vs Staged Files

- **Untracked Files:** Files in your working directory that Git is not tracking yet. Usually new files.
- **Staged Files:** Files marked using `git add` to be included in the next commit.

Understanding the difference helps you control which changes go into your commits.

## Commits and Git History

- **Commit:** A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
- **History:** Commits form a timeline stored as a linked list in Git.
- Each commit has a unique SHA hash, author details, message, and references to parent commits.

Commits allow you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate safely.
