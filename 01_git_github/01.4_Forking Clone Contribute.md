# Fork, Clone, and Contribute ðŸ”€

When contributing to someone else's project, especially open-source repositories, we usually follow these steps:

---

## Fork

- Creating your own copy of another user's repository on GitHub under your account.
- This allows you to freely make changes without affecting the original repository.

---

## Clone

- Downloading your forked repository to your local machine.
- You work on the code locally by cloning it using:
 # bash
  git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
