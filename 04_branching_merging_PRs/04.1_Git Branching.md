# Git Branching Explained

## What is a Branch in Git?

A branch in Git is like a separate line of development.

It lets you work on features, fixes, or experiments independently without affecting the main code.

Think of branches as parallel universes of your project.

## Why Use Branches?

- To isolate new work from the stable main code (`main` or `master` branch).
- To enable multiple people to work on different features simultaneously.
- To safely try new things without risking your main codebase.

## How Does Branching Work?

- When you create a branch, Git just creates a new pointer to a specific commit.
- Initially, the new branch points to the same commit as your current branch.
- As you commit on a branch, the branch pointer moves forward independently.
