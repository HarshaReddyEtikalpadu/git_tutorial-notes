## 2️⃣ Working with Files (Working Directory & Staging) 🗂️

- `git status`  
  🔍 See current file changes and staging status.

- `git add <file>`  
  ➕ Stage a specific file for commit.

- `git add <file> <file2> <file3>`  
  ➕ Stage to add specifics file for commit.

- `git add .`  
  ➕ Stage all changed files in the current directory.

- `git reset <file>`  
  ↩️ Unstage a file (remove it from staging, keep changes).
  Eg: git reset -- "03_git_commands/03.1 Useful Git Commands.md"
    Now, this file comes to working directory like untracked files.

- `git reset`

  ↩️ Unstage all files (remove it from staging, keep changes).

- `git reset -- "file1" "file2" "file3"`

  ↩️ Unstage specific files (remove it from staging, keep changes).

- `git checkout -- <file>`  
  ❌ Discard changes in working directory for a file (restore last commit).

## 1. `git restore <filename>`

- **Purpose:**  
  Discard local changes in the working directory and restore the file to the last committed state.

- **When to use:**  
  You modified a tracked file but want to undo changes before staging or committing.

- **Effect:**  
  Changes are lost and file resets to last commit version.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  git restore example.txt
  

2. git restore --staged example.txt

- `git merge <branch-name>`  
  🔀 Merge changes from another branch into the current one.

- `git branch -d <branch-name>`

- `git push -u origin <branch-name>`  
  📤➕ Push branch first time and set upstream tracking.

## 6️⃣ Undoing Changes ⏪

---

### 1. 🔄 `git revert`
**Purpose:** Undo a commit by creating a new commit that reverses changes.  
**Commands:** `git revert HEAD`, `git revert HEAD~1`, `git revert <hashcode>`  
**Example:** `c1 -- c2 -- c3`, run `git revert HEAD` → `c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c3'` (*code looks like c2 now*)

---

### 2. 🧹 `git reset --soft`
**Purpose:** Undo commits by moving HEAD back but keep all changes staged (ready to commit).  
**Commands:** `git reset --soft HEAD~1`, `git reset --soft <hashcode>`, `git reset HEAD` (no effect)  
**Example:** `c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 (HEAD)`, run `git reset --soft HEAD~1` → HEAD at `c3`, changes from `c4` staged.

---

### 3. 🧩 `git reset --mixed` (default)
**Purpose:** Undo commits, unstage changes, keep changes in working directory (files changed but not staged).  
**Commands:** `git reset HEAD~1` (same as `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`)  
**Example:** `c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 (HEAD)`, run `git reset HEAD~1` → HEAD at `c3`, changes from `c4` unstaged but in files.

---

### 4. 💥 `git reset --hard`
**Purpose:** Undo commits and discard all changes in staging area and working directory.  
**Commands:** `git reset --hard HEAD~1`  
**Example:** `c1 -- c2 -- c3 -- c4 (HEAD)`, run `git reset --hard HEAD~1` → HEAD at `c3`, changes from `c4` lost permanently.

---

### 1. 🛑 `git clean`
- By itself, does nothing or shows a warning. Usually needs options to work.

### 2. 👀 `git clean -n` (or `--dry-run`)
- Shows which untracked files and directories *would be deleted* without actually deleting them.
- Use to preview before deleting.

### 3. 💥 `git clean -f` (or `--force`)
- Deletes untracked files permanently from working directory.
- Use when you are sure you want to remove untracked files.
- Does **not** delete ignored files unless used with `-x`.

---

## Bonus: Helpful Commands 🎁

  📥 Temporarily save working directory changes without committing.

- `git stash pop`  
  📤 Restore the last stashed changes and remove them from stash.
