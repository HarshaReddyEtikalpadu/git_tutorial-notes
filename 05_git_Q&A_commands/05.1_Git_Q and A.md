# Git & GitHub Interview Q&A 

---

### 1. What is Git? Why do we use it?
**Answer:**  
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently, manage different versions, and maintain code history.

---

### 2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
**Answer:**  
Git is a version control tool running locally, while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories that provides collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and more.

### 3. How do you clone a remote repository?
**Answer:**  
`git clone <repo-url>` downloads a remote repository to your local machine.

---

### 4. Explain the difference between git pull and git fetch.
**Answer:**  
`git fetch` downloads updates from remote but doesnâ€™t merge;  
`git pull` fetches and merges changes into your current branch.

---

### 5. How do you create a new branch and switch to it?
**Answer:**  
`git checkout -b <branch-name>` creates and switches to the new branch.

---

### 6. What is the staging area in Git?
**Answer:**  
The staging area (or index) is where changes are added before committing. It acts as a buffer between the working directory and the local repository.

---

### 7. How do you undo a commit that has already been pushed to the remote?
**Answer:**  
Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes, preserving history.

---

### 8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
**Answer:**  
Open the conflicting files, manually fix conflicts, mark resolved with `git add <file>`, then commit the merge.

---

### 9. What is the purpose of .gitignore?
**Answer:**  
To specify files and directories Git should ignore (not track), like IDE settings or build files.

---

### 10. How do you contribute to an open-source project on GitHub?
**Answer:**  
Fork the repo, clone your fork, create a branch, make changes, push to your fork, and create a pull request to the original repo.

---

### 11. How do you set up your username and email for Git commits?
**Answer:**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
